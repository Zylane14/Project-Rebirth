// HOW TO USE THIS ASSET PACK //
////////////////////////////////

Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders named PNG and spritesheet.

- In the PNG folder, you'll find four folders.
	- effects: This folder contains the sparkle effect animations.
	- outline_dark: This folder contains the objects and items with a dark outline.
	- outline_light: This folder contains the objects and items with a light outline.
	- outline_none: This folder contains the objects and items with no outline.

- In any of the outline folders, you'll find all of the images and animations. Animations are represented as folders, with the frames as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folder contains a texture atlas for every single image in the asset pack. A metadata file is provided alongside the spritesheet which may be used to parse the image.

- Recommended animation FPS: 15 (66.7 ms/frame)
