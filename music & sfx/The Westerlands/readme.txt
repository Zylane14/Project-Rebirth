Hello and thanks for downloading the free fantasy music pack «The Westerlands».
This pack contains 7 tracks (Wav and mp3) of original fantasy music.

You are free to use this music as you wish, and you do not have to credit me, but if you do, that would be much appreciated.
I hope you enjoy the music and that it will suit your creative project!

If you want to check out more of my music or support my musical endeavours then please visit my youtube channel, soundcloud page, or itch.io profile for more music and music packs in the future.
